Libaraies used in the code -- Numpy, Queue

In all the files I have stored the array in columnwise format i.e

1 4 7 2 5 8 3 6 0

means
 
1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  0

I have used dictionary to store parent associations. 

I have used a layer index to decide the priority of the node to be pushed
The parent_index is the node_index of the parent_node.The code runs correctly as all the neighbour nodes are given the same layer index.

I have used Priority Queue to store nodes and a dictionary to store the offsets instead of
a function after consultation with TA (Saksham Verma)
